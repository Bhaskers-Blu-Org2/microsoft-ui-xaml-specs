# Background
Currently, NavigationView's MenuItems list allows for displaying a flat list of items in the pane. 
It's common for apps to want to present users with a hierarchical navigation tree. 
This feature adds the capability to nest items within the pane. 


# Hierarchy
To show a hierarchical list of nested navigation items in the pane, use NavigationViewItem's `MenuItems` property.
Each *NavigationViewItem* can contain other NavigationViewItems and organizing elements like item headers and separators. 
Although NavigationViewItem can contain any number of nested levels, we recommend keeping your appâ€™s navigation hierarchy shallow. 
We believe two levels is ideal for usability and comprehension.

NavigationView shows hierarchy in all its pane display modes, including Top and LeftCompact.
