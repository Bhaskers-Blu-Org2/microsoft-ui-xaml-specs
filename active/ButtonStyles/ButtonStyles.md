# Button Styles detailed design spec / redline
This spec lists out all the details of button styles design that should be updated as part of [#953](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/953). Depending on schedule and other unforseen circumstances, not all could be implemented so this does not represent a final plan yet.

## Button styles
There are two main button styles Windows application might consider using depeneding on type of usage:
1. Outline
2. Fill

Outline style is less visible to users compared to Fill style and are more appropriate to be used on form type of UI where it is not the [**default button**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/dialogs-and-flyouts/dialogs#defaultbutton).

Fill style is more visible especially against background that is not a solid color. Windows shell tend to use this style more as the buttons tend to be drawn on top of other UI element that is not solid white or black.

There is no strict rules for which style to use, however use of the button in a consistent manner within your UI that has the same meaning will help your user navigate your app's UI with less effort.
